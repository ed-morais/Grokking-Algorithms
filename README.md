# Grokking Algorithms Exercise Repository

Welcome to my Grokking Algorithms exercise repository! This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply clone or fork it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/grokking-algorithms.git
```

## Structure

The repository is structured by chapters, with each chapter having its own directory. Within each chapter directory, you will find a subdirectory for each exercise, labeled by the exercise number. Within each exercise directory, you will find a README.md file with the exercise prompt and my solution in a separate file (usually named solution.py).

## Contributing

If you have a better solution to an exercise, or if you notice an error in one of my solutions, please feel free to open a pull request with your changes. I'm always happy to learn from others and improve my understanding of the topics covered in the book.
